# Primer

A simple ruby application for finding the nth prime.

## More?

More than anything, this is me working to improve my understanding of ruby
& testing.

Specifically built to answer
[Problem 7 from Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/problem=7 "Problem 7 | Project Euler")

## How do I use this and its amazingness?!

`ruby bin/primer` should do the trick, though I'm new at this thing.

## Things I've learned thus far (as obvious as they may be)

### Methods
- keep them small
- only a few lines
- if there is a lot going on -> too complicated
